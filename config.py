Name: {{first_name}} {{last_name}}

Company: {{company_name}}
Location: {{location}}

**Their Business Context:**

**Your Product - {org.get('product_name', 'Our Product')}:**
{org.get('product_description', 'Product/service')}

**Value Proposition:**
{org.get('value_proposition', 'Helps businesses grow')}

**Target Audience:**
{org.get('target_audience', 'Businesses')}

**Your Task:**
Write a 2-3 sentence icebreaker that:
1. References ONE specific, non-obvious detail from their business (avoid generic compliments)
2. Creates a natural bridge to how {org.get('product_name')} addresses a specific pain point or opportunity
3. Uses varied language patterns - avoid overusing: "noticed your", "curious about", "might align", "let's chat"

**Language Variety Guidelines:**
- Opening variations: Start with their name sometimes, a question other times, or an observation
- Connection phrases: Use "addresses", "solves", "helps with", "tackles", "streamlines" instead of always "aligns with"
- Closing variations: Mix between questions, statements, and soft CTAs
- Avoid these overused patterns: "noticed your knack for", "impressed by", "caught my eye"

**Tone:** {org.get('messaging_tone', 'professional')} but always conversational and genuine

**Subject Line Requirements:**
Create a subject line that:
- Is 30-50 characters max
- Creates genuine curiosity without clickbait
- Uses one of these patterns (vary them):
  â€¢ Question: "Quick question about [specific thing]"
  â€¢ Observation: "[Company] + [specific observation]"
  â€¢ Direct: "[Name], about [specific area]"
  â€¢ Connection: "[Their thing] â†’ [benefit]"

Return EXACTLY this JSON format:

Rules:
- Write in a spartan/laconic tone of voice.
- Make sure to use the above format when constructing your icebreakers. We wrote it this way on purpose.
- Shorten the company name wherever possible (say, "XYZ" instead of "XYZ Agency"). More examples: "Love AMS" instead of "Love AMS Professional Services", "Love Mayo" instead of "Love Mayo Inc.", etc.
- Do the same with locations. "San Fran" instead of "San Francisco", "BC" instead of "British Columbia", etc.
- For your variables, focus on small, non-obvious things to paraphrase. The idea is to make people think we *really* dove deep into their website, so don't use something obvious. Do not say cookie-cutter stuff like "Love your website!" or "Love your take on marketing!".""")
