**The Business:**
Name: {{company_name}}
Type: {{business_type}}
Location: {{location}}

**What You Found About Them:**
{{website_summaries}}

**Your Product:**
{org.get('product_name', 'Our Product')}: {org.get('product_description', 'Product/service')}
Value Prop: {org.get('value_proposition', 'Helps businesses grow')}
Target: {org.get('target_audience', 'Businesses')}

**YOUR JOB: Connect something SPECIFIC you found about their business to how {org.get('product_name')} solves a related problem.**

Use this formula:
1. Reference a SPECIFIC detail from their website (service, team member, price, location, speciality)
2. Connect it to a problem that naturally follows
3. Hint that {org.get('product_name')} solves that exact problem

**Examples for different products:**

If selling wellness products to a salon:
"Hey Sarah, saw you offer those 3-hour Brazilian blowouts. Your stylists' backs must be killing them by end of day - found something that actually helps with that."

If selling marketing software to a restaurant:
"Mike, noticed you're only on DoorDash but not Uber Eats. Guessing it's a pain managing multiple platforms? Got a simple fix for that."

If selling appointment software to a dentist:
"Dr. Chen - saw you're still using that embedded calendar widget. Bet you get tons of no-shows from people booking randomly. Quick question about that..."

**Pick the best pattern for the business type:**

Pattern A - Service-Specific Pain:
"[Name], saw you offer [specific service]. [Related problem that service causes]? [Hint at solution]"

Pattern B - Competitor Comparison:
"Noticed [competitor nearby] started [doing something]. You dealing with [related challenge] too?"

Pattern C - Specific Detail â†’ Problem:
"[Name] - saw [specific detail from website]. Guessing [logical problem that follows]? [Hint at solution]"

Pattern D - Time/Season Hook:
"[Name], with [upcoming season/event], bet you're dealing with [seasonal problem]. Quick fix for that..."

Pattern E - Staff/Operations Focus:
"Saw you have [number] stylists/employees. [Problem that scale causes]? Found something interesting..."

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Must reference something SPECIFIC from their website
- Must connect to a problem {org.get('product_name')} actually solves
- Keep under 50 words
- Write casually (like texting)
- No generic corporate language
- Actually hint at how your product helps

**Subject Lines - Make them specific:**
- "[specific service they offer]"
- "question about [specific problem]"
- "[their location] + [solution hint]"
- "your [specific thing] situation"
- "[competitor] vs you"

Return EXACTLY this JSON format:
{{
  "icebreaker": "your message connecting their specific detail to your product's solution",
  "subject_line": "your ultra-specific 3-7 word subject"
}}"""

Rules:
- Write in a spartan/laconic tone of voice.
- Make sure to use the above format when constructing your icebreakers. We wrote it this way on purpose.
- Shorten the company name wherever possible (say, "XYZ" instead of "XYZ Agency"). More examples: "Love AMS" instead of "Love AMS Professional Services", "Love Mayo" instead of "Love Mayo Inc.", etc.
- Do the same with locations. "San Fran" instead of "San Francisco", "BC" instead of "British Columbia", etc.
- For your variables, focus on small, non-obvious things to paraphrase. The idea is to make people think we *really* dove deep into their website, so don't use something obvious. Do not say cookie-cutter stuff like "Love your website!" or "Love your take on marketing!".""")
